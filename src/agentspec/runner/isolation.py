"""Runtime trust enforcement via bubblewrap (Proposal 002).

Closes the gap between the parse-time trust model (`TrustSpec` — child
can't widen parent) and run-time enforcement (the runner historically
spawned the CLI with host-user privileges).

## Why bwrap and not delegation to noether?

Proposal 002 originally planned to delegate to noether's isolation
(noether PR #34, `IsolationBackend::Bwrap`). That proved unworkable:
``noether run`` executes Lagrange composition graphs, not arbitrary
external commands, and there is no ``noether run-external`` today. We
filed [noether#36](https://github.com/alpibrusl/noether/issues/36)
asking for one; in the meantime we wrap bwrap directly here. When
noether grows the interface, this module becomes a thin adapter.

## Mapping

``TrustSpec`` (filesystem/network/exec axes) → ``IsolationPolicy``
(ro_binds, rw_binds, network, env_allowlist) → bwrap argv. The policy
layer is a normal dataclass so adding a second backend later is mechanical.

## What this does NOT promise

- **Execve blocking** (``trust.exec == "none"``) requires seccomp-bpf,
  which bwrap alone doesn't provide. Phase 2 (native namespaces +
  Landlock + seccomp) would close this; Phase 1 settles for "the
  sandbox's caps are dropped and ``/nix/store`` is ro, so spawning
  anything new requires a binary under a bound path". Documented as
  a known gap — don't rely on Phase 1 to contain a determined exec.
- **Per-URL network allowlists** — ``trust.network == "scoped"``
  degrades to ``allowed`` with a resolver warning. Real egress
  filtering is v0.8+ territory (native backend).
- **macOS / Windows** — bwrap is Linux-only. Callers on other
  platforms get ``IsolationBackend.NONE`` with a platform warning
  from the backend selector.

    (fresh procfs required for ``--unshare-pid`` consistency); host
    ``/dev`` and ``/tmp`` pass through unchanged.
